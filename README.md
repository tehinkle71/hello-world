# hello-world
just another repository


Commits are edits or changes to a file.
This was a copy of the master until I made changes.

After this, submit a pull request to ask someone to pull your chagnes and merge into their branch.
Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
